### ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Iâ€™m a C++ and Python developer with over 12 years of experience building high-performance systems, from large-scale simulation infrastructure to real-time control firmware. I've contributed to open-source projects like [ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse), [BetaFlight](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight), and created tools such as [BLHeli Configurator](https://github.com/blheli-configurator/blheli-configurator), used by thousands of FPV enthusiasts across platforms.

My work spans motion planning, distributed compute, simulation pipelines, and data storage systems. I value clear abstractions, thoughtful engineering, and practical impact.
